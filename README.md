# PNG-Flood-Fills
<strong>The Fill Algorithms</strong>

This project was based on a number of C++ functions that execute a "flood fill" on a PNG image. To flood fill a region of an image, the user specifies a point on the image and a fill pattern and all points similar in colour and adjacent to the chosen point are changed to the fill pattern. 

The animations in the .gif images are the result of breadth-first-search (BFS) and depth-first-search (DFS), all with a different type of colour fills (eg. stipe fills, the heart fills, and rainbow fills).

Run this program by typying ./main imageName fillerType X-starting-point Y-starting-point

you output image will be found in images/output.gif and images/output.png! 

demos of this program found in: https://www.yixuanqi.ca/#/flood-fills/

ENJOY! ！！
